    "The temporary satisfaction of quitting is outweighed by the eternal suffering of being nobody.",

    "You must put in the effort to get the life you want.",
    "I do know how to administer CPR. However, I will not administer CPR unless you’re a hot female… If you’re some fat dude and you just had a heart attack and I don’t really know you, you’re gonna die… No, not even if you’re a friend… If you’re my friend, you just can’t be a p*ssy. ‘Well, I had a heart attack’, get the f*ck up. F*cks wrong with you. Go hospital later. Have a drink, cigarette, cup of coffee, back in the game. F*cking having heart attacks near me, you little pussy.",
    "You know exactly what to expect from an enemy. An enemy is going to attack you and you know how to deal with that. A friend, on the other hand, can betray you.

It’s a war for status. Masculine life is war. If you’re a man who doesn’t view life as war, you’re going to lose. Society’s expectations of men are much higher than the societal expectations of females.",
